                        Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is a communications protocol for message-oriented middleware based on XML (Extensible Markup Language). It enables the near-real-time exchange of structured yet extensible data between any two or more network entities. The protocol was originally named Jabber, and was developed by the Jabber open-source community in 1999 for near real-time instant messaging (IM),presence information, and contact list maintenance.
